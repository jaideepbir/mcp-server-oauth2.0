---
Timestamp: 8/3/2025, 9:28:33 PM
Summary:
- The user reported that `sample.csv` still doesn't load for the demo user, upload button freezes, and console errors. Admin can load `sample.csv` but gets "no rows returned" for `protected.csv`. Admin can upload and view, but demo user cannot.
- Read `authz.rego` to understand the OPA policies.
- Modified `authz.rego` to allow all users to read public files (`/data/public/`) and allow users to upload/write files to the uploads directory (`/data/uploads/`).
- The user reported that after rebuilding/restarting, the demo user can view `sample.csv` but not `protected.csv` or uploaded files. Admin can view all.
- Read `main.py` to investigate the owner mismatch for uploaded files.
- Modified `main.py` to align the `subject.sub` for the demo user with the "demo" owner string, resolving the owner mismatch.

---
Timestamp: 8/3/2025, 9:37:23 PM
Summary:
- Resolved "No response from server for read" and upload button freezing by adding detailed logging to `projects/mcp-server-oauth2.0/services/mcp-server/app/main.py` and ensuring the `owner` is correctly passed for OPA evaluation in the `upload_file` endpoint. The user confirmed the issue is resolved.
